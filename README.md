## Usage
1. Follow the prompts and input the required information, such as the employee number you want to calculate, the monthly work period, the number of days worked in the month, and the clock-in and clock-out times for each workday.
2. Generate a payslip to view the detailed breakdown of the employee's earnings for the month.
